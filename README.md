# leadr

A time limited secret microblog for groups with the possibility of revealing all posts at a later date

# demo
The website is currently live [here](https://leadr.freeciv.life)

#background
This is an experiment around a slow paced long running game and whether it would be possible to set up a 'secret twitter'
The idea is that nobody can see your 'tweets' - we call them jots until the end of the game.
This means you can document plans, attacks, intrigue etc.

#review
It worked well - sadly only a few players jotted regularly, but reading the jots is entertaining.

#future
I have a vague dream of this being developed into something to be used on stag or hen dos or other fairly long term events featuring the same people.
